\subsection{Neutral Kaon Decay Channels}\label{sub:neutral-kaon-decay-channels}
As previously mentioned, it is possible for a kaon to decay as $K_S^0 \to 2\pi^0 \to 4\gamma$, and in fact we expect this decay to occur about $30\%$ of the time while the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mode covers the remaining $70\%$ of decays\footnote{There are a few other decay modes each with branching fractions of far less than $1\%$.}~\cite{Zyla2020}. It is straightforward to see that the fraction of $K_S^0 K_S^0$ pairs which both decay to charged pions is $70\%\times 70\%=49\%$, so it may seem like ignoring the neutral pion channels leaves over half of the potential data unobserved. While this is true in theory, these channels are much more difficult to reconstruct in practice. First, the acceptance effects on angular distributions will differ due to the photons being detected in the FCAL or BCAL while the charged pions are detected in the CDC or FCD. Second, because both the kaon and $\pi^0$ are neutral, the kaon decay vertex is ``detached'', meaning we cannot reconstruct the decay vertex of $K_S^0 \to 2\pi^0$ nor\footnote{Technically, the decay $\pi^0 \to 2\gamma$ is governed by electromagnetic interactions, so its decay time is much shorter than that of the kaon and is not long enough to be observed by the GlueX detector anyway.} that of $\pi^0 \to 2\gamma$. This makes it impossible to use sPlot on the channel where both kaons decay to neutral pions, since there are no vertices with which to determine the rest-frame lifetime. In the channel with one $K_S^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decay, we can perform sPlot using the single rest-frame lifetime distribution, but due to the way the kinematic fit is written, we cannot constrain the mass of a kaon with a detached vertex, meaning we must then perform some background subtraction on the invariant mass distributions of these kaons, introducing a further complication in the analysis. Additionally, these channels have different backgrounds than the one used in this analysis, since the final state can be recombined in more ways than the charged pions. These issues make the total reconstruction efficiency of neutral-pion decay channels lower, since they are less constrained and tend to let in more background than the fully charged-pion decay channel, despite the signal reconstruction efficiency being approximately the same across all channels. While we examined these alternative channels during the analysis, we have not included them in this thesis since the additional work required to refine them is not worth the small gain in statistics, though they may be of interest in future studies when GlueX collects more data.
